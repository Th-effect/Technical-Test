What are the odds?

Memory refreshing for algorithmic skills (graph theory).

The main focus was about the algorithm, how to model the problem, then bridge my current knowledge to the IA landscape.
Its all about graph theory (discrete maths).
Next step requires to transform this problem into a product.
well the transformation is straight forward once we established a minimal poc.
it depends on the scale of the data to define the appropriate solution.
Using python stack, the easiest  option is to use flask + docker + database + tests
